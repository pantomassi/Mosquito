-COMMANDS-
1) Commands not requiring the drone to be in the air (but will also work there, apart from 'take off', which is a non-action):
- 'battery'
- 'emergency' - also works in the air, but remember that it will stop the motors immediately as well
- 'altitude'
- 'temp'
- 'picture'
- 'video' - a new frame with video stream will appear and no other actions can be performed until it's closed with 'Q' key
- 'take off'
- 'exit' - terminate the whole app. If your drone was flying, it will land first

2) Commands requiring the drone to be airborne:
- 'land'
- 'go {forward/back/left/right/up/down} {distance_20-999cm}'
- 'turn {left/right} {degrees_1-360}'
- 'turn back' (will do an auto 180 degrees turn)
- 'flip {forward/back/left/right}'
- 'set speed {10-100cm/s}'


-NUMBERS-
Required for {go/turn/set_speed}.

-0 is passed as 'oh'.
-100 can be passed as 'hundred' or 'hundred'.
-Other numbers > 100 are passed as '{1-9} hundred {1-99}'

Examples:
-'go forward two fifty' will send a command to the drone to move 250cm ahead
-'turn right one oh five' - the drone will turn in place 105 degrees clockwise
